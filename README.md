## Task
Create a game in python.

## My Project
I have created a classic 2D space shooter game using a canvas wrapper i  wrote around the pygame libary.

## How to Play
- To shoot aim move the mouse around the player and to shoot press any mouse button.
- There are no movment controls so to move you must use the recoil from fireing bullets.
- Enemies are the green squares and if they touch you you will take damage.
- If you shoot an enemy however it will loose health.
- Once all enemies are dead the next wave will appear and will be more powerful than the last.
- If you take damage from an enemy your health will turn partly yellow.
- You are able to regen this part if you make it to a power up (the blinking purple boxes).
- However if you take to long that health will turn red and then it is gone forever.

## Libaries and Versions
- For the graphics i used the pygame (version 1.9.3) libary.
- I used a canvas wrapper around this that i also wrote that gives and object based canvas as well as asynchronous methods.
- The whole thing is in Python version 3.5.2
